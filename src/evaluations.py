"""
LLM response evaluation service using composition pattern.

This module provides evaluation services that can work with any LLMClientInterface
implementation. It uses composition rather than inheritance to separate evaluation
logic from LLM client implementations.

Includes utilities for parsing evaluation responses and validating scores.
